            <b>11. How do the functions of money overcome the problems associated with barter?</b><br>
            Money solves the inefficiencies of barter through three specific functions. [cite_start]First, as a <b>medium of exchange</b>, it eliminates the "double coincidence of wants," meaning buyers no longer need to find a seller who simultaneously desires exactly what they have to trade[cite: 88]. [cite_start]Second, as a <b>unit of account</b>, money provides a single, standardized measure of value, replacing the millions of relative prices (e.g., 1 cow = 50 chickens) required in a barter economy[cite: 88]. [cite_start]Finally, as a <b>store of value</b>, money allows purchasing power to be saved for the future, whereas many barter commodities (like food) are perishable and lose value over time[cite: 88].<br><br>

            <b>12. What is seigniorage?</b><br>
            [cite_start]<b>Seigniorage</b> is the revenue or profit that a government (or central bank) generates from the issuance of currency[cite: 89]. It is calculated as the difference between the <b>face value</b> of the money (e.g., a $100 bill) and the marginal <b>cost of producing</b> and distributing it (e.g., printing costs of a few cents). [cite_start]This "profit" effectively acts as a source of revenue for the state, allowing the government to acquire real goods and services in exchange for the currency it creates[cite: 89].<br><br>

        <p>
            <b>1. Money's function as a medium of exchange means that:</b><br>
            (c) money serves as an acceptable means of payment.<br><br>

            <b>2. Suppose an increase in the supply of money occurs, while the demand for money is constant. According to the quantity theory of money, the price level will:</b><br>
            (b) rise because as people try to spend excess money balances, prices are driven up.<br><br>

            <b>3. If there were no reserve requirements on banks:</b><br>
            (a) banks would still hold reserves.<br><br>

            <b>4. Which of the following correctly defines the components of the monetary base?</b><br>
            (d) Reserves at the Fed, vault cash and currency in circulation.<br><br>

            <b>5. Commercial banks are able to create money by:</b><br>
            (b) making loans.<br><br>

            (c) can create an amount of money equal to its excess reserves.<br><br>

            <b>7. The reason a multiple expansion of deposits can occur is because:</b><br>
            (c) one bank's excess reserves are loaned out and end up as excess reserves in other banks.<br><br>

            <b>8. The reserves of a commercial bank:</b><br>
            (e) All of the above.<br><br>

            <b>11. Please define bank runs, contagion, and financial panics.</b><br>
            [cite_start]A <b>Bank Run</b> occurs when a large number of depositors lose confidence in a bank's solvency and attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, creating a liquidity crisis for the bank[cite: 211]. [cite_start]<b>Contagion</b> refers to the "spillover effect" where the failure or distress of one financial institution spreads fear and instability to other, otherwise healthy institutions due to psychological panic or financial interconnections[cite: 211]. [cite_start]A <b>Financial Panic</b> is a systemic collapse of confidence in the financial markets, characterized by widespread bank runs, a crash in asset prices, and a severe contraction in credit availability[cite: 211].<br><br>

            <b>12. Identify examples of moral hazard and adverse selection for a person buying car insurance.</b><br>
            [cite_start]<b>Adverse Selection</b> occurs <i>before</i> the transaction takes place: high-risk drivers (e.g., those with a history of accidents) are more likely to actively seek out insurance than safe drivers because they anticipate a higher benefit from the payout, leading the insurer to attract a riskier pool of customers[cite: 212]. [cite_start]<b>Moral Hazard</b> occurs <i>after</i> the transaction is completed: once a driver has purchased comprehensive insurance, they may engage in riskier behavior (like driving faster or parking in unsafe neighborhoods) because they know the financial burden of any damage or theft will be borne by the insurance company rather than themselves[cite: 212].<br><br>

            <b>2. Which of the following is correct? The monetary base consists of:</b><br>
            (b) vault cash, currency in circulation, and bank deposits at the Fed.<br><br>

            <b>3. The reason a system of many banks can create a multiple expansion of bank deposits is that:</b><br>
            (d) reserves need only to be a fraction of demand deposits.<br><br>

            <b>4. If everything is held constant, interest rates should increase if:</b><br>
            (d) the demand for money curve shifts to the right.<br><br>

            (a) its value as a good equals its value as money.<br><br>

            <b>6. As a commodity (e.g., the use of gold for jewelry), the value of commodity money:</b><br>
            (a) is equal to its value as money.<br><br>

            <b>7. According to the classical quantity theory, in the short run, a 10 percent increase in money supply:</b><br>
            (a) increases the price level by 10 percent.<br><br>

            <b>11. Which problems does a barter economy suffer from?</b><br>
            [cite_start]A barter economy suffers from significant inefficiencies, primarily the <b>double coincidence of wants</b>, which requires that a buyer find a seller who has exactly what they want and wants exactly what they have[cite: 68]. Additionally, barter lacks a common <b>unit of account</b>, making it difficult to express and compare prices across different goods. [cite_start]It also lacks a standardized <b>store of value</b>, as many goods are perishable or difficult to store, and it makes <b>deferred payments</b> (contracts for future payment) extremely complex to negotiate[cite: 68].<br><br>

            <b>12. Which three variables of the economy can central banks influence?</b><br>
            Central banks exert control over the economy by influencing three primary variables. First, they manage <b>Interest Rates</b> (specifically short-term rates like the Federal Funds Rate) to control the cost of borrowing and economic activity. Second, they control the <b>Money Supply</b> (or the Monetary Base) through open market operations to manage liquidity and inflation. [cite_start]Third, they can influence <b>Exchange Rates</b>, either indirectly through interest rate differentials or directly through foreign exchange interventions[cite: 69].<br><br>

            <b>11. Identify the differences between M1, M2, M3</b><br>
            The difference lies in their liquidity. [cite_start]<b>M1 (Narrow Money)</b> is the most liquid aggregate, consisting of currency in circulation and checkable (demand) deposits that can be used immediately for transactions[cite: 149]. [cite_start]<b>M2</b> includes everything in M1 plus "near monies" that are slightly less liquid, such as savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and small-denomination time deposits (CDs)[cite: 149]. [cite_start]<b>M3 (Broad Money)</b> is the least liquid measure, comprising M2 plus large-denomination time deposits and institutional money market funds[cite: 149].<br><br>

            <b>12. Judge whether credit cards should be a form of money.</b><br>
            Credit cards are <b>not</b> considered money; they are distinct financial instruments. Money is an asset that serves as a final means of payment. [cite_start]A credit card, by contrast, is a method of <b>deferring payment</b>[cite: 150]. When a credit card is used, the card issuer pays the merchant on behalf of the user (using actual money), and the user incurs a liability (debt) to repay the issuer later. [cite_start]Therefore, the card itself acts as an identification card to access a credit line, not as a store of value itself[cite: 150].<br><br>
